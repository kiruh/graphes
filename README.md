This project was created as a homework at Plovdiv University.

It's implemented with React.

`npm start host`

And open in your browser http://localhost:3123/

### Or go see it [live](https://dijkstra.netlify.com/)

### Instructions

Shortcuts to manage your graph:

**Ctrl+Click on sheet**: Add node

**Click on node**: Select node
